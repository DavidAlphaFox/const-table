# Const-table - a space-efficient variant of minimal perfect hash-tables for Common Lisp

This implementation is based on the paper by [Botelho & Ziviani](http://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~nivio/papers/cikm07.pdf).

For now, more info can be found in this [blog post](https://lisp-univ-etc.blogspot.com/2018/01/minimal-perfect-hash-tables-in-common.html) and in the source code :)
